0x02 FUNCTIONS AND NESTED LOOPS
This task aims at introducing the concepts of functions and nested loops in c programming.
There are two types of functions; Library functions and user-defined functions. 
Library defined: these functions are declared in the c header files such as scanf(), printf(), gets(), puts(), ceil(), floor() etc.
User-defined: are functions which are created by the c programmer, that he can use many times.
